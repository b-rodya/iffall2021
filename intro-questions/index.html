        <h1>Introductory Questions [and Answers]</h1>
        <h2><b>1. Q: What is your name, major, and year?</b></h2> 
            <p>My name is Ray Brody, I'm a Communication Design Major, and I'm a Junior!</p>
        <h2><b>2. Q: Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></h2>
            <p> I'm taking this class to fulfill a major requirement, I mostly draw stuff so this is super out of my comfort zone.</p>
        <h2><b>3. Q:Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></h2>
            <p> I am a little baby peanut brain, I have never coded before in my life :(</p>
        <h2><b>4. Q: Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></h2>
            <p></p>I'd like to pick up some basic coding skills from this class because, like I said, I'm a baby brain and haven't done this before.</p>
        <h2><b>5. Q: Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></h2>
            <p>Managing visuals to be compatible with mobile and desktop devices should be interesting.</p>
        <h2><b>6. Q: Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></h2>
            <p><a href="https://fontsinuse.com">Fonts in Use</a></p>
            <p>This website is for discovering fonts and examples of those fonts in use (hence the website name) I think that this website communicates its information very clearly. All of the information is easily accessible, each font is set in its respective typeface so viewers can immediately determine what the font looks like. The visuals displayed alongside the name of the font immediately tell the user what the font can be used for.</p>
        <h2><b>7. Q: Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></h2>
            <p><a href="https://meowwolf.com"> Meow Wolf</a></p>
            <p>This is the website for the network of interactive art installations managed by Meow Wolf. Meow Wolf's founders wanted to make an installation or series of installations that made art fun, inclusive, and accessible to the everyday person. I think that the Meow Wolf website does a good job of conveying the desire to make art fun through the use of bubbly transitions and saturated colors. The website also clearly communicates where to go to buy tickets, current events, and other important information by clearly displaying a menu at the top.</p>
        <h2><b>8. Q: Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></h2>
            <p><a href="https://theuselessweb.com">Useless Web</a></p>
            <p>This website is meant to take the user to a variety of useless websites. It is very straightforward and easy to use, it responds to user input quickly, and it does not take the user to the same site twice</p>
