            </p>
            <p>
        Discord's webpage is effective in communicating the fun and youth-oriented branding of the discord app. It is also very effective at immediately direcitng the viewer to a login button and download button, which are the two most important functions for using discord. I really like its straightforwards nature.

            </p>
            <p>
        The Wikipedia homepage is quite full of information, it provides the user with helpful descriptions on recent articles that can be quickly skimmed to get a better idea of the article's content. The sidebar on the left side gives the viewer immediate access to various tools and settings without the need of a dropdown menu.

             </p>
            <p>
        The Calarts homepage is like a more well-designed version of the standard college homepage, everything is easy to read and easy to find. The balance of dropdown menus to buttons to articles that can be accessed via scrolling is very nice. I personally hate trying to click on one button and being greeted with a lengthy dropdown menu. I'm also just a fan of the modern looking fonts and the slight tilt given to the menu items.
